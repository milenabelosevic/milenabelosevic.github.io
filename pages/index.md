I'm a linguist working at **Bielefeld University** (Germany). My research connects discourse and media linguistics with conversation analysis and humanâ€“computer interaction. I investigate **trust**, **grounding**, and **linguistic patterns** (e.g., name-based word formation) in texts, dialogues, and multimodal data. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3
