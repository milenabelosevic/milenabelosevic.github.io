My research combines qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the relationship between linguistic and extralinguistic patterns in texts and dialogues. In interdisciplinary projects, I investigate how corpus-linguistic, experimental, and computational approaches advance the study of how humans and machines produce and interpret patterns of language use.


### Name-based word formation patterns in German


During my work as a postdoctoral researcher in the research unit [Project “Musterhaftigkeit – Linguistic Creativity and Variation”](https://patterns.uni-trier.de/) (funded by the Rhineland-Palatinate Research Initiative, 2019–2023), I developed an interest in the role of individual and collective extralinguistic knowledge in the production and interpretation of word-formation patterns. As part of my habilitation project, I examined how different contexts, such as text types and media (e.g., newspapers vs. social media) or discourse domains (politics, sports, and celebrities), affect the production and interpretation of name-based compounds and compound-like patterns in German. The empirical focus is, first, on a type of compound in German that has received little attention to date, featuring a personal name as the second constituent (e.g., *Kabinen-Merkel*), and second, on name blends as a compound-like phenomenon, such as Merkozy from (Angela) *Merkel* and (Nicolas) *Sarkozy*. Methodologically, the study combines corpus-linguistic and experimental approaches.


### The linguistic construction of trust, mistrust, and fear in German media 


As part of my PhD project, I examined how trust, mistrust, and fear were constructed in German media coverage of the refugee debate (2015–2017). Drawing on the concept of argumentation patterns (topoi), I operationalized the sociological concept of trust for a discourse-analytic study. Using corpus-linguistic methods, I tested whether trust toward refugees changed from 2015 to 2017 across argumentation patterns identified through manual annotation. Subsequently, I applied this approach to other domains of public discourse, including Euroscepticism and the public debate about COVID-19. I also co-organized the conference on [Language and Trust](https://sprache-und-wissen.de/veranstaltungen/tagung-2021/) and co-edited the volume [Sprache und Vertrauen. Facetten der linguistischen und interdisziplinären Vertrauensforschung](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111452883/html).


###  Patterns of interaction with language models

This project builds on my habilitation and PhD theses, and extends their methods and research questions to human-machine interaction. Current results examine language models' ability to interpret common ground phenomena and domain-specific meanings across discourse domains in both text corpora and naturally occuring dialogues. A practical strand asks how users’ trust can be calibrated depending on the models' demonstrated performance at producing and identifying context-sensitive linguistic patterns (see e.g., [Belosevic 2025](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/record/3006958), [Belosevic & Buschmeier 2024](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2988195/2989187/BelosevicBuschmeier-2024-CUIatCHI.pdf)).
