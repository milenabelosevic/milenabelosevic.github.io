My research combines qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the relationship between linguistic and extralinguistic patterns in texts and dialogues. In interdisciplinary projects, I investigate how corpus-linguistic, experimental, and computational approaches advance the study of how humans and machines produce and interpret patterns of language use.

 ## Name-based word formation patterns in German

During my work as a postdoctoral researcher in the research unit [Project “Musterhaftigkeit – Linguistic Creativity and Variation”](https://patterns.uni-trier.de/) (funded by the Rhineland-Palatinate Research Initiative, 2019–2023), I developed an interest in the role of individual and collective extralinguistic knowledge in the production and interpretation of word-formation patterns. As part of my habilitation project, I examined how different contexts, such as text types and media (e.g., newspapers vs. social media) or discourse domains (politics, sports, and celebrities), affect the production and interpretation of name-based compounds and compound-like patterns in German. The empirical focus is, first, on a type of compound in German that has received little attention to date, featuring a personal name as the second constituent (e.g., *Kabinen-Merkel*), and second, on name blends as a compound-like phenomenon, such as Merkozy from (Angela) *Merkel* and (Nicolas) *Sarkozy*. Methodologically, the study combines corpus-linguistic and experimental approaches.

 ## The linguistic construction of trust, mistrust, and fear in German media 

As part of my PhD project, I examined how trust, mistrust, and fear were constructed in German media coverage of the refugee debate (2015–2017). Drawing on the concept of argumentation patterns (topoi), I operationalized the sociological concept of trust for a discourse-analytic study. Using corpus-linguistic methods, I tested whether trust toward refugees changed from 2015 to 2017 across argumentation patterns identified through manual annotation. Subsequently, I applied this approach to other domains of public discourse, including Euroscepticism and the public debate about COVID-19. I also co-organized the conference on [Language and Trust] [http://sprache-und-wissen.de/veranstaltungen/tagung-2021/] and co-edited the volume [Sprache und Vertrauen. Facetten der linguistischen und interdisziplinären Vertrauensforschung] [Sprache und Vertrauen
Facetten der linguistischen und interdisziplinären Vertrauensforschung].
